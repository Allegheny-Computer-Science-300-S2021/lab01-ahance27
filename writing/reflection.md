## Lab01, Instructions

In this practical assignment, you are to add your responses to the questions in blue of the lab. Your reflection should be about a page and contain clear and meaningful language. Please use markdown language to format your reflection piece.

Please write below this line to address the above-mentioned points. Replace the word,  with your response.

### First Tool: PolyPhen 2

 1. What kind of research is this method or tool used for?

 PolyPhen2 (Polymorphism Phenotpying v2) is used for predicting the functional effects of    human Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms.

 2. How does this method or tool work? What does it do?

 PolyPhen2 is a tool that predicts possible impacts of amino acid substitution on human
 proteins. It uses the sequence. phylogenetic and structural information for the substitution. When mapping the amino acid replacement on a 3D model, it can visibly show what parts of the protein be directly affected by the substitution.

 3. Why do you think that this method or tool was necessary to develop?

 I think that this tool was necessary to develop because it can be used to predict mutations, and also effects the amino acids have on human cells. And in terms of COVID-19 attacking human cells, it could be used to research or work on vaccines for the virus.

 4. What undesirable consequences could result from the misuse of this method of tool?

 Since the tool has very specific input requirements, if someone put incorrect information into the query for this tool, it could result in misleading information.

### Second Tool:

 2. How does this method or tool work? What does it do?


 3. Why do you think that this method or tool was necessary to develop?


 4. What undesirable consequences could result from the misuse of this method of tool?
